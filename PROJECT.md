# InfoMentor assignment - Project Description

We would like you to create a service that connects to and reads weather forecast information from the Icelandic national weather forecast service. The API is available at:
[https://www.vedur.is/um-vi/vefurinn/xml/]

### Tasks

1. Design a user interface that presents weather forecast information. The user interface can be absolutely anything. E.x. website, mobile app, CLI, traditional windows app, etc.

2. The application should be able to accept input from the user (selecting what forecast to show).

3. The application should display forecast information based on the data available in the vedur.is API.

### Requirements

1. Create a repository (Github or any other you prefer) to commit your code to.

2. You are free to use any programming language that you wish. But note that our working language is .NET.

3. Include all source code and (if possible) a pre-compiled/packaged version of your app that can be run directly.

4. Make sure you include clear instructions on how to build and run your application along with your source code (i.e a README).

5. If you borrow code from the internet (like we all do) then please clearly attribute that code and where it was obtained from.

6. Please document clearly all major assumptions and design decisions/limitations that you make in your solution.

### Evaluation

Your solution will be evaluated based on a number of factors, including

- Clarity and maintainability.
- Technology and framework choices with respect to task complexity.
- Organization of source and resources.
- Accuracy and quality of the documentation.
- Testability of the source code.

Please make sure your submission is an accurate representation of what you consider quality software and showcases what you value in software development, how you wish to work, how you approach coding and what you feel is important when building and deploying solutions to production.

We would like to ask you to hand in your solution to us before your next interview. Please send your submissions to the hiring manager (i.e. just attach it to a reply to the email you got from us).

Good luck!
